Alright figuring out how to do some things with a staticly generated site.

These are my repos:

Site: https://github.com/jessiepuls/jessie.wtf

Theme: https://github.com/jessiepuls/simple-hugo-theme


If there were a blog there'd probably be a  [post](test).

We'll add bloggy business to the template next and figure out how one goes about publishing content in reasonable ways.
